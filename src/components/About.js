                <p>Overall my inspiration for this project was to combine my history
                    background with what I've been learning these past few months 
                    the end result was this.
                    I think it's important for Black people across the U.S. 
                    to get in touch with their history BEFORE 1619 and study the many Black scholars
                    that dedicated their lives to research. While our story from 1619 to the present day is 
                    vital in understanding out current position in this country, it is one chapter, not the 
                    ONLY chapter.

                    I've always been intrigued by the stars, space, the planets, etc. Like 
                    a lot of kids I wanted to be an astronut for a short time. It wasn't until 
                    a few years ago that I learned that the first astronomers and astrologers were
                    Ancient Egyptians. In that moment I was taken back to the time I wanted to live among the 
                    stars and wondered what if I knew then what I know now? How would my life be different?
                    Would I have taken that "silly" dream seriously? 
                </p>

                    This is only a small glimpse of what I want to do with these new skills. While this 
                    isn't the most impressive showing of a SPA it's still only the beginning.
